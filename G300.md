# Ourghs Vs.Dwarves:

### Project Summary:

MSCH-G300 Production I, Final Project.
<br>

Made using the [Brackey's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk&ab_channel=Brackeys) for a 3D tower defense as a base, with a restructing to be based off fantasy rather than sci-fi, and was produced in Unity 2019.4.17f.

### Development Process:

This was a completely solo project where I had cpontrol over aspect of the game. I was the equivalent to the artist, programmer, builder, tester, and more over the course of the making of the project. <br>

This particular project was interesting to deal with as we were tasked with finding and adapting a tutorial. While ther wer esignficant advnatages for having done this, there was sometimes brutal tradeoffs in restructuring a whole project to adapt it for another similar, but still different purpose. 

### Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot over the course of this project. <br>

It was here where Object-Oriented programming really began to click in my mind. New doors in terms of game complexity were opened with just a few examples given to me, also thanks to the class and teachers I had as well.<br>

This project ultimately represents a milestone in my progress as a programmer where I implemneted strong coding principles such as the singleton pattern, and AI behavior, while I also picked up great experience towards my longterm goal of being a Technical Artist.<br>

This is because over the course of the project I learned a lot about not only materials, but also 3D particle effects and how to manipulate their variables for best effects.
