### Project Summary 
<p>
MSCH-C220 Game Technology Final Project, made in the game engine Godot.
</p><br>
<p>
We took inspiration from Space Shooters like Galaga, but iour twist was putting it in deep ocean water instead of space. We also took inspiration from the third project in the class, being a more pedantic attempt at creating a space shooter. 
</p>

### Development Process:

This was my first ever personal project that had to be made with other people. Up till this point I had only ever done smaller projects here or there, so there were growing pains in doing version control with others for the the first time. This also was done in a 72 hour game jam format, leaving little time to fret over exact design elements. <br>

Due to this fact, I had a lot of say, probably more than I should have over the whole project. This also was an entry level course for the game design program, and the only other game design student on my team was only going for a minor in the program. This lent me more ethos in my decisions then there should've been, but we also were only sophomores in our Fall semester.

### Lessons Learned:

I learned to have confidence in my pixel art skills, and in myself as a programmer. I started to feel that working in the industry wasn't a nebulous goal but rather felt like something achieveable, and I also saw for the first time how juice was an extremely important in selling a game to the audience in their minds, after getting the project functional.<br>

I also learned how to work under pressure, which is ironic considering the game's title is the closest we could get in Latin to "Under Pressure.", and was also the theme of the game jam.
