# Erin and the Otherworld:

### Project Summary:
<p>
Erin and the Otherworld is a deck builder rogue-like with a heavy emphasis on drawing constellations as the main mechanic for energy generation and  serves as the main source of interactivity. The story more so focuses on an eternal druid, who uses the constellations to channel energy into rituals along her yearly journey to seal away the monsters plaguing the land.

### Role:
Programmer, Designer, Creator

### Release Status:
Release by SP 2023

### Development Process:
<p>
The development process has been informed by a variety of factors. From time, energy, and resource management difficulties, to some nasty bugs, fundamental infrastructure flaws, and mid-implementation pivots, there has been a lot to work through and learn from. 

As the Head Programmer, I helped spearhead and catalogue meetings between me and my co-programmer early on, and even as those wained, we set up crucial elements of the system design without even putting code to line. 

I also helped split duties between the two of us, and made sure to help across tasks when able or necessary. This lead to a very productive use of divide and conquer, which we used to complete our game for the most part. 
</p>

### Lessons Learned
<p>
The main things learned from this project so far have been:
<br>
1. The importance of communication.
<br>
2. The need for proper mental and physical health stability on a longterm project.
<br>
3. Giving the right effort and resources to the proper element, and determining that as can be best surmised at a given time. 
<br>
4. C# knowledge involving assembly definitions, IEnumerators on a deeper level, iterative loops, proper splitting up of ideas into a more rigid class structure, and class cross talk between scripts. 
<br>
5. And last but not least, maintaining an understanding of one's own codebase from using comments, summaries, debug statements, commit updates, and personal notes. All are necessary for further memory of what was properly being worked on last for a given element in the codebase.
