# Erin and the Otherworld:

### Project Summary:
<p>
Erin and the Otherworld is a deckbuilder roguelike with a heavy emphasis on drawing constellations as the main mechanic for energy generation and  serves as the main source of interactivity. The story more so focuses on an eternal druid, who uses the constellations to channel energy into rituals along her yearly journey to seal away the monsters plaguing the land.
