# King's Landing:

## Project Summary:
<p>
This was a 2D Platformer that was made in C220 Game Technology in the game engine Godot. This project was initally a struggle for me to start and to finish, but still taught me many lessons, such as 2D tilemaps, and helped form the fledgling concepts of object oriented programming in my mind. 
</p>

## Development Process:
<p>
This is my most abnormal development process since I made the game based off the assets I could find for a 2D platformer, and in fact made it after my final project for my class
</p>

## Lessons Learned
<p>
This was, like Subtormentum a pivtol project for me to learn the importance of adding "juice" to a project. Sound, art, cohesion across gameplay and game feel, these were parts that this project was missing due to me having been past the deadline.
</p>

<p>
All I could think of conequently while I worked to just get it "done" was how time management was important to the health and overall success of a project. Something I've increasingly gotten better on since this project.
