# Main Project: Realtai: A Druid's Burden (placeholder)
My name is Josh Tonner, and I am the Head Programmer for Realtai: A Druid's Burden. The title is a deckbuilder roguelike with a heavy emphasis on drawing constellations as the main mechanic for energy generation and  serves as the main source of interactivity. The story more so focuses on an eternal druid, who uses the constellations to channel energy into rituals along her yearly journey to seal away the monsters plaguing the land.

This role includes responsibilites such as: The creation and maintaining technical architecture, creating and communicating programmer meeting notes, and the faciliation of designer idea implementation. 
Meaning that the programmers on the team have been serving the roles of many other technical positions. From environmental artist to technical artist, we've controlled most asset and pipeline implementation/faciliation and fill any role that would normally be a different position on a larger team. 

In having this responsibility I've grown in not only my understanding of what's required in a team environment but also my skill set in providing value to a team. From UI scripting to player functionality, I've had to work through it all, and not without their own growing pains.

My current skillset covers the following areas: Java, C#, Python, Maya 2022, Vicon Blade, 3D Substance Designer, Unity and Unreal. (Ideal statement down the line)

(I would put a picture but realized I technically need permission from Marceline). With that line the portfolio is still under works and this is to get used to updating this down the line (primarily come summer-August) - Josh To Will

# Other Projects:

### Subtormentum

[Link to "Subtormentum Project"](./Subtormentum.html "Subtormentum Project").

### Summary:
This is my first game jam project, where I made most of the scripting, art, and did most of the asset implementation in the game engine Godot. The main theme was "Under Pressure" which we applied to Latin to get Subtormentum. It was in a classroom environment so the work was mandatory and as such I contributed more than my peers purposefully for that reason. 

### Ourghs Vs. Dwarves

### Summary:
This is one of my first major projects, and is my own take on the Youtuber Brackey's tutorial on making a 3D Tower Defense. It hasn't been updated since it's initial release, but was solely made by me, and represented a strong period of growth in both programming and artistic skills in regards to Game Design for me.

### Prototype: 451

### Summary:
This is a small title made from my current team around the concept of Fahrenheit 451 but you are a detective who hunts down the book owners. I was the primary programmer and asset implementer, and made the game in about a week's time.

### King's Landing

### Summary: 
This is my solo 2D platformer game from a class early in my Game Design major program, which resulted is a very brief and simplistic 2D side scroller made in Godot. I'm particular proud of the main screen, which I made myself without any reference.
