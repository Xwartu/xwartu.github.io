# About Me:
My name is Josh Tonner, and I am the Head Programmer for Erin and the Otherworld.
<br>

This role includes responsibilities such as: 
The creation and maintaining technical architecture, creating and communicating programmer meeting notes, and the facilitation of designer idea implementation. 
<br>

In having this responsibility I've grown in not only my understanding of what's required in a team environment but also my skill set in providing value to a team. From UI scripting to player functionality, I've had to work through it all, and not without their own growing pains.
<br>

I know both good coding techniques and design aesthetics. Iâ€™m great at taking in new information and changing accordingly, and have heard and thus consider myself a great team player. Understanding systems and then being able to use them is a speciality of mine, stemming from a strong skill of reading comprehension. 
<br>

My current skillset covers the following areas: Java, C#, Python, Maya 2022, Vicon Blade, 3D Substance Designer, Unity and Unreal. (Ideal statement down the line)
<br>

I am  currently a Game Design Major with a Specialization in Programming pursuing a Technical Artist career path, and I am set to graduate May 2023. 
<br>

On a personal note, I am a fan of Destiny 2 by Bungie Interactive, a PlayStation fanboy at heart, and love a good book. A series I currently recommend is the Red Rising Trilogy by Pierce Brown.
