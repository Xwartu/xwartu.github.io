## About Me:

<head>
I know both good coding techniques and design aesthetics. I’m great at taking in new information and changing accordingly, and am a great team player. Understanding systems and then being able to use them is a speciality, and something I’ve always been able to do.

<head>
I am a Game Design Major with a Specialization in Programming poursuing a Technical Artist career path, and I am set to graduate May 2023.

On a personal note, I am a fan of Destiny 2 by Bungie Interactive, a PlayStation fanboy at heart, and love a good book. A series I currently recommend is Red Rising by Pierce Brown.
