# About Me:

I know both good coding techniques and design aesthetics. I’m great at taking in new information and changing accordingly, and am a great team player. Understanding systems and then being able to use them is a speciality, and something I’ve always been able to do. 
<br>

For example, I picked up how to code this website and host it on a custom domain in about 3 days.
<br>

I am  currently a Game Design Major with a Specialization in Programming poursuing a Technical Artist career path, and I am set to graduate May 2023. 
<br>

On a personal note, I am a fan of Destiny 2 by Bungie Interactive, a PlayStation fanboy at heart, and love a good book. A series I currently recommend is Red Rising by Pierce Brown.
