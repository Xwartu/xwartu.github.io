# About Me:

I know both good coding techniques and design aesthetics. Iâ€™m great at taking in new information and changing accordingly, and have heard and thus consider myself a great team player. Understanding systems and then being able to use them is a speciality of mine, stemming from a strong skill of reading comprehension. 
<br>

This stems to covering new programs and languages all the time, which are always a pleasure to see. 
<br>

I am  currently a Game Design Major with a Specialization in Programming poursuing a Technical Artist career path, and I am set to graduate May 2023. 
<br>

On a personal note, I am a fan of Destiny 2 by Bungie Interactive, a PlayStation fanboy at heart, and love a good book. A series I currently recommend is the Red Rising Trilogy by Pierce Brown.
