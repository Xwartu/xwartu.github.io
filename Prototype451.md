# Prototype 451:

### Project Summary

A one week game jam for MSCH-C400 Production II, made by Workshop Group 5, in Unity 2020.3.16f
<br>
Inspired by Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

### Development Process:

This was my first project that was purely a group based project, as well as my most recent work. We talked over what felt like every aspect and we tried our best to involve each team member when we could. <br>

I primarily did the bulk of the implementation and wrote a lot of code from scratch. The mechanic ansd UI implementation took time, but the end result was satisfactory. In the end, we achieved our original vision perfectly. 

### Lessons Learned:

Involving every team member slowed down our development process, but also made the group vision stronger. <br>

I learned a lot about making code legible and readible to others. Programming for two was a new expeirence to me that I hadn't had much ability to experience before. Now I feel better going forward in creating documentation, while also navigating the pitfalls of version control.
